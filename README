i3lockmore by Sven Greiner <sven@sammyshp.de>

This is a wrapper for i3lock that adds additional functionality:

    --pixelate [scalefactor]
        Uses the pixelated screen content as the background of the lockscreen.

        The optional value "scalefactor" controls the size of the pixels. A value
        of 1 results in large pixels while a value of 100 has no effect.
        (It scales down the background to "scalefactor" percent of the original
        screen content).

    --dpms timeout
        Uses DPMS to turn the screen off after "timeout" seconds of inactivity.

        CAUTION: This sets --nofork (see "man i3lock") to restore the previous
        value of the DPMS timeout after the screen was unlocked.

All other arguments are passed to i3lock.

Dependencies: i3lock, bash, imagemagick, xset
